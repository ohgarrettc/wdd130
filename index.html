            <p>Hello! My name is Garrett Curley and I am from Gallup, NM. I currently live in Manor, Texas (close to Austin). My family was recently displaced from western North Carolina because of hurricane Helene. My major is applied technology. I currently work at Apple and have been struggling to finish my degree. I originally got into tech because of a desire to learn how to code but with A.I. being more of a thing, I am a little hesistant to devote all of schooling to programming. I have since learned that I am extremely interested in learning more about cybersecurity and along with completing classes at BYU-I, I am completing the Google Pro Cybersecurity certificate on Coursea.</p>
            <p>I am married to my beautiful wife, Jenny. We met when she was going to school at BYU. We have four children. Our oldest is Bennett, he just turned 12. Next is Eloise, who is 10. And our twins; Vera and Ewan are 6. We also have a dog named Chad Ochocino but we call him Cinco for short.</p>
            <p>Some things I enjoy are watching films, participating in Karaoke, going to concerts, and one talent I have; I can play the ukulele.</p>
